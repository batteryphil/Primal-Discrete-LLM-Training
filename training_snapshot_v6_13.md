# Training Snapshot: Protocol v6.13 (Post-Ignition)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-21 20:20:00 (Local Time)
**Step:** 6610+
**Protocol Status:** v6.13 (Gamma Overflow Patched)

## Key Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| **Loss** | ~9.35 | Trending downwards post-ignition |
| **Entropy** | 10.71 | **All-time low** / Core settling |
| **Logic Ignition** | ACTIVE | Loops engaged (4 iterations) |
| **Core Activity** | **35.73%** | **PROJECT RECORD** (Tripwire Logged) |
| **TPS** | ~9,850 | Sustained forward pass efficiency |
| **GPU Mem** | ~11.0 GB | Fully utilized (1080 Ti) |

## Manifold State
- **Token Embeddings:** 1.28% activity.
- **Reasoning Gate:** High-pressure voting active (35%+).
- **Refinement Gate:** 0% (Preparing for re-alignment).
- **Output Head:** 0% (Consensus reset; pending re-train).

## Legacy Preservation Note
All pre-v6.12 ignition logic and pre-v6.13 overflow logic has been preserved in `ghost_core.py` and `primal_train_modular.py` as commented-out blocks for historical reference.
