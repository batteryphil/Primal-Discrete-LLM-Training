PROTOCOL v5.6: CODER'S TANDEM & SENTINEL RECOVERY DYNAMICS
================================================================================

1. THE VOTING SYSTEM (DISCRETE GRADIENT ACCUMULATION)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "Tandem" system uses two discrete 8-bit grids (Base and Fine) to mimic 
floating-point precision without needing floats for inference.

A. VOTE ACCUMULATION (Backward Pass)
   Gradients are analyzed against sensitivity thresholds. If a gradient is 
   "loud" enough, it casts a ±1 vote into int16 accumulators.

   - Structural (Base) Threshold: g_mean + (sensitivity_base * g_std)
   - Syntactic (Fine) Threshold: g_mean + (sensitivity_fine * g_std)

B. THE STOCHASTIC STEP (apply_tandem_votes)
   Votes only resolve into index changes based on an adaptive probability.
   - Fine Grid: Flipped if rand() < (adaptive_prob * 2)
   - Base Grid: Flipped if rand() < (adaptive_prob * 0.5)

C. CARRY PROTOCOL
   When the Fine index overflows its range (±120), it resolves into a structural
   shift (+1/-1) in the Base grid and resets to 0. This creates a "multi-scale" 
   discrete weighting.

2. THE SENTINEL SYSTEM (TRAINING GOVERNOR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Governor acts as an automated flight controller, monitoring the "heartbeat"
(flip rate) and "vital signs" (loss) to prevent stagnation.

A. DETECTION: THE STALL STREAK
   A stall is declared if:
   - Bit Flips <= 0.0005% (Flatlining) OR
   - Loss is NaN/Inf (Explosion detected)

B. RECOVERY PHASE 1: MELTING (Stall Streak 5-19)
   - Lowers 'Fine' sensitivity (makes it easier for bits to flip).
   - Injects 10% Fine Jitter (random ±1 noise).
   - Voltage Spike: Boosts voltage scale by 10% to "thermalize" the manifold.

C. RECOVERY PHASE 2: THE SLEDGEHAMMER (Stall Streak 20+)
   - Structural Jolt: Shakes foundation weights (Base Grid) with 5% noise.
   - Heavy Jitter: 30% Fine noise injection.
   - High Voltage/High Gain: Triggers a 3.0x LR multiplier to blast through 
     quantization local minima.

3. THE CIRCUIT BREAKER (SAFESTEP)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An autograd safety layer that intercepts corrupted gradients before the weights 
are update.

- NaN/Inf Detection: Iterates through gradients after unscaling.
- Automatic Abort: If corruption is found, the optimizer.zero_grad() is called,
  the scaler is updated (to reset state), and the step is skipped.
- Integration: Directly feeds into the Sentinel's recovery loop to trigger 
  vibration/reset.
